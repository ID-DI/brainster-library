# Project_02

This project is the second cornerstone in my development as Full Stack developer while attending the Brainster programming academy and they attest for the commitment and knowledge that was needed to achieve the goal of becoming Full Stack developer.

## Description
The project is about creating webpage for online library. The webpage consist of two main sides, user side and library admin. The library admin has the duties to to do CRUD for categories, authors, books and public comments. The public comments can be posted only by registrated users  (and can be seen by all users after their validation and user can leave only one message per book) who also have a option to leave personal notes who can only be seen by the user. If the user is not loged in, he can only see the public messages.   

### Tools
The project was created ussing HTML, CSS,BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and PHP.

### Opening the project
If you want to see the project online you can visit the following page: https://brainsterlibrary.noir.mk/. If you want to see the page as registrated user you can use the following credential:
login:ivan12@gmail.com  password:Ivan!@12 or you can make your own account by pressing the sign up button on the navbar. If you want to visit the page as library admin use the following credential: login:admin@admin.com password:Admin!123@. If you want to open the project in code editor - VS, all you need is to upload the SQL library - brainster_library.sql in your MySQL account or what ever are you using and in the db.php who is Project 02/backEnd/classes/db.php change the settings that corespond with your MySQL account that is "mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=brainster_library", "root", "","
                        (localhost here)    (no change)            (username) (password)
and start the project throug the index.php.

## P.s
For reasons unknown to me I cannot get the admin panel public comment section working on-line, but it works as smooth as it can when we opened it locally through PHP live server on VS code or through localhost - php/MyAdmin. I hope you'll take that in consideration, and expalin to where did I go wrong.

### Thanks and I hope you'll like it.
